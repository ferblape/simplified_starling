Simplified Starling
===================

NOTE: This is work in progress, I'm currently extracting this from a project.

You can put anything into Starling, but after using Starling on a couple of 
projects I've seen I use always the same hash for storing the jobs.

    job[:type]
    job[:task]
    job[:id]

To Do List
==========

- Create YAML file with the configuration
- Store pid file of queue
- Test

Example
=======

    ##
    # app/controllers/typus/newsletters_controller.rb
    #
    class Typus::NewslettersController < TypusController
    
      def test
        job = {}
        job[:type] = "Newsletter"
        job[:id] = params[:id]
        job[:task] = 'test_rendering'
        STARLING.set('newsletter', job)
      end
    
    end

    ##
    # app/models/newsletter.rb
    #
    class Newsletter < ActiveRecord::Base
    
      ##
      # Your task
      #
      def test_rendering
      end
    
    end
